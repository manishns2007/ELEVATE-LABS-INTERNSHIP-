Weak passwords (short, dictionary-based) → easily cracked in seconds with brute force/dictionary attacks.

Moderate passwords (mixed characters but short) → survive longer but still vulnerable to targeted attacks.

Strong passwords (long, random, mixed characters) → take years or even centuries to crack.

Passphrases (long + random words + symbols) → easier to remember but very strong.
