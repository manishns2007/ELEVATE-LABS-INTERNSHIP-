Nmap is the powerful tool used for the network scanning.
-sn — ping scan (only discover which hosts are up; no port scan)
-Pn — skip host discovery (treat hosts as up)
-sS — TCP SYN scan (default stealthy scan, requires root).
-sV — service/version detection (probe services to discover versions).
-O — OS detection.
