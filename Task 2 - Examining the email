When We view this email it looks like it is really urgent but,
we should be very much aware of the keywords , sentence formation also the links provided
here in the sample email we can see that the email address
Display name = PayFast Support (looks legitimate).
Address = support@payfast.example.com → suspicious because domain payfast.example.com is a subdomain of example.com (not the real payfast.com).
Also real company domains rarely use example — flagged as spoof/subdomain trick.
