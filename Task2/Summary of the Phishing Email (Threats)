Suspicious sender address – Display name says PayFast Support, but the email address is support@payfast.example.com, which does not match the legitimate domain (payfast.com). Likely spoofed.

Header discrepancies – Would show SPF/DKIM/DMARC failures and originating IP not linked to the brand’s mail servers (classic spoofing indicator).

Mismatched/obfuscated URLs – Visible link: https://payfast.example.com/... vs actual clickable link: https://tiny.example/verify-link. This mismatch is a strong phishing red flag.

Urgent and threatening language – “Verify your account within 24 hours” and “permanently suspended” create pressure to act quickly, a common social engineering tactic.

Formatting & branding issues – No official logo, footer, or contact details. Professional financial institutions normally include these.

Grammar/phrasing issues – While spelling is correct, phrasing is awkward and lacks professionalism (e.g.If you did not attempt to access your account…).

Overall Risk: HIGH – The combination of spoofed sender, mismatched URLs, urgency, and suspicious attachment strongly indicates phishing.
